## Description
This project, entirely in Vue.JS 2, represents the culmination of the *frontend phase* of the [Boolean Careers](https://boolean.careers/corso/full-stack-web-developer) course.
Following the instructions and graphics provided, I prepared this demo landing page by also adding some unsolicited features, which include:
- responsive design (Bootstrap 5.1.3)
- a JSON file that simulates an API data flow, where texts, menu items and images (file names) come from:
   ```
   \src\components\siteContent.json
   ```
- an expandable panel on the left side (gear icon)
- the panel includes three graphic editing functions
   - choice of three alternative colors to blue (default color)
   - dark mode, in tone with the chosen color
   - three font sizes (large, default, small)
